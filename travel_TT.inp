# Remarks will appear in the summary file. The "Remark" directive can be
# abbreviated and has two alternative forms:

Remark		SIMULATION WITH TEMPERATURES	# 1.- Single-line remarks.

Rem &eor					# 2.- Multi-line remarks.

This is a first example of an input file for AIRES.
I'm trying to learn how to use AIRES, because it's important for us.

Task learn1  # Use "Task learn1 5" to explicitly set task version to 5.

# The following directives are mandatory (have no default values)
# Look that TAB characters can also be used in place of blanks.

TotalShowers		1000

# All other parameters will be assigned a default value if not set.

Ground     1000 g/cm2  # Most quantities are specified by two fields:

                       # g/cm2, cm, m or km

# You can freely set the number of observing levels to record the shower
# longitudinal development. You can define up to 510 observing levels and
# (optionally) altitude of the highest and lowest levels.
